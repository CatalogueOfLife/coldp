1001	morphology	eng	fna	Perennials, 10–30 cm (taproots thick, caudices swollen, often covered by old leaf bases). Stems 1–3, erect (often reddish), stout, mostly simple, sparsely to densely tomentose, often stipitate-gland-ular proximally. Leaves basal and cauline; petiolate (at least basal); blades elliptic, runcinate, 8–20 × 2–5 cm, margins pinnately lobed (lobes broadly lanceolate, coarsely dentate, midribs often reddish), apices acute, faces sparsely to densely tomentose, stipitate-glandular. Heads 2–22 (1–3 per branch), in cymiform arrays. Calyculi of 8–10, deltate or lanceolate, tomentose bractlets 3–8 mm. Involucres cylindric, 11–21 × 5–15 mm. Phyllaries 10–14, lanceolate, 10–14 mm (margins yellowish), apices acute, abaxial faces glabrous or ± tomentose, sometimes setose and stipitate-glandular, adaxial glabrous or with fine hairs. Florets 11–40; corollas yellow, 16–20 mm. Cypselae dark or pale brown to yellowish, fusiform, 6–11 mm, apices ± tapered, ribs 10–13; pappi whitish, 6–13 mm. 2n = 22, 33, 44, 55.
1001	description	eng	fna	Crepis bakeri is generally recognized by the low stature, dense rosettes of pinnately lobed leaves with coarsely dentate lobes, tomentose stems and leaves, stipitate-glandular hairs distally on stems, relatively large involucres, and densely flowered heads. It is considered closely related to C. occidentalis. Three somewhat weakly defined subspecies were recognized by E. B. Babcock (1947).
1001	description	eng	wp1	Crepis bakeri is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common name Baker's hawksbeard. It is native to the western United States where it grows in many types of mountain and plateau habitat. It is found in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, northern California, Nevada, and Utah.\nCrepis bakeri is a perennial herb producing a dark green, hairy, glandular stem up to about 30 centimeters (12 inches) tall from taproot and a thick caudex at ground level. The leaves are narrowly oval and fringed with shallow lobes. They are dark dusty green with reddish or purplish veins and the basal leaves approach 20 centimeters (8 inches) in maximum length. The inflorescence is an open array of up to 22 flower heads. Each has a base of lance-shaped phyllaries which are hairy and often bristly. The flower head contains up to 60 yellow ray florets. There are no disc florets. The fruit is a thin achene up to a centimeter long with an off-white pappus.
