763. GUNDELIA TOURNEFORTII Compositae
Nicholas Hind
Summary. Gundelia toumefortii L. (Compositae: Gundelieae) is described and illustrated, and its strange inflorescence morphology highlighted. The history of the discovery of this fascinating plant is covered from one of the first natural history collections made in the late 16th century in the Levant. The problematic taxonomy of this genus is discussed, both supragenerically and infragenerically. The species has very rarely been cultivated throughout its recent history, making a commentary on its cultivation and propagation a little difficult. The wide range of uses cover a history dating back at least 10,000 years, from the Neolithic sites of Iraq and Turkey, to its present day usage in the region. The importance of herbarium specimen data, as well as literature, for the ethnobotany of taxa is emphasized. A possible biblical connection is commented on in relation to the Shroud of Turin.
The subject of this plate is one of the more unusual plants to have appeared in Curtis’s Botanical Magazine in that it has a demonstrable history of use of over 10,000 years, is still very rarely cultivated, and has potential links to the dawn of Christianity, via the Shroud of Turin; it also has one of the most complicated inflorescence structures in the family, and an interesting taxonomy. The plant is Gundelia toumefortii L. (Compositae: Gundelieae).
i 6th Century history
Gundelia toumefortii, as we now know it, was first recorded in one of the earliest natural history collections made in the Near East by the German physician, botanist and traveller, Leonhard Rauwolf [also as Leonhart Rauwolfl] (1535-1596). His voyage, between 1573 and 1575, was principally made to search for supplies of herbal medicines, the botanical collections (which he ‘glued upon paper very carefully’
... ‘with great and peculiar care’ ... ‘so that they are to be seen in their natural colours so exact, as if they were green.’ - translations from Ray, 1738) preserved in bound quarto-sized, and one folio, herbaria (now in Leiden). A description of these volumes is provided by Legré (1900), covering the French collections, based in part upon Saint-Lager’s account (Saint-Lager, 1885: 69-85), who also detailed the 338 specimens in the folio volume (the ‘Vierte Kreutterbuch...’), most collected during Rauwolfs Levant voyage - page number 251 is the specimen of Gundelia, from ‘Alep. Baibout en Anatolie’. Rauwolfs views on the countries and cities, peoples and religion, and plants were recorded in the German Aigentlkhe beschreibu.ngderR.aifi, so er vordisergjritgegen Auffgang inn dieMorgenlander (Rauwolf, 1583) - ‘A true account of the voyage to the Levant ... \ The Morgenlànd (literally the ‘land of the morning’) of the tide is the Levant in English (from the French levant = ‘rising’ i.e. where the sun rises), and Bilâd ash-Shàm (Uu-VsGh) in Arabic.
The Levant is an archaic English word, according to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, dating from the late 15th century, and is defined as the ‘eastern part of the Mediterranean with its islands and neighbouring countries’. It is usually considered to include modern Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Cyprus, Hatay Province and parts of southern Turkey, northwestern Iraq and the Sinai Peninsula. The Levant portion of Rauwolf s expedition began in Tripoli, Lebanon, to the ‘mighty city’ (translated as the ‘potent city’ in Ray, 1738) of Aleppo, Baghdad and Mosul, returning to Tripoli and ending with a trip to Jerusalem. Rauwolf left Tripoli on November 9, 1573 bound for Aleppo (probably arriving later that month), spending several months in and around the city. Chapter VI of his book was ‘Of the situation of the potent city of Aleppo; of the buildings therof, and also of the delicate fruits and fine plants, that grow there, within and without gardens’. [Translation from Staphorst in Ray, 1738].
17TH Century history
Rauwolfs Aigentlkhe beschreibung der Raifi was well illustrated with woodcut illustrations, including Gundelia, whose plate was effectively repeated in Bauhin el al.'s Historia plantarum universalis (1650-1651) under the name Hacub sive Silybum quibusdam. The plant w'as found in the area around Aleppo, in Syria. Bauhin et al.'s short description appears to have been taken straight from Rauwolfs account and suggested the plant was known to Dioscorides as Silybum, and to Serapio Joannis Filii Serapionis or Yuhânnà Ibn Serapion; author of a 9th Century work called ‘Practka ... ’ an ancient materia medica] as Hacub Alcardeg; the Arabic Ka’ub or A’kub is still in use today. It should, however, be noted that Rauwrolf (1583), Bauhin et al.
(1650-1651) and Ray (1738) were incorrect in declaring that this plant was Dioscorides’ Silybum - that plant is now considered to be Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (the Milk Thistle).
Based on Rauwolfs description Morison (1699: 167 - albeit in a work published long after he was dead), although admitting he had not seen the plant, provided a new name - Eryngium Syriacum foliis Chamaeleontis longis & spinosis - based on the apparent similarity of the synflorescence to the inflorescences in several species of Eiyngium L. [Umbelliferae].
i8th Century history
A little while after the publication of his seminal work, Eléments de botanique, ou méthode pour reconnaître les plantes (1694), Joseph Pitton de Toumefort (1656-1708) travelled together with the German physician and botanist Andreas von Gundelsheimer (1668-1715) (eventually a physician to the Prussian royalty) and the painter Claude Aubrict (1665-1742), who became the principle artist at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris (where Toumefort had earlier been appointed professor of botany in 1683). Their expedition, between 1700 and 1702, was to travel through Greece, Turkey, Armenia (which included parts of present day Turkey) and Persia. Toumefort’s account of the expedition was published posthumously as Relation d’un voyage du Levant (de Toumefort, 1717), the second volume of which appeared in English (de Toumefort, 1718). Tournefort’s prose in his Voyage into the Levant is worth repeating here:
Lett. VI. p. 187: ‘We were oblig’d then to leave Baibout the 11th of June. We were told the Bassa <1> had pardoned all the Prisoners.
	<1> = Pasha

Many in our Caravan commended his Clemency; others blamed him for not making some Examples. The Rogues were made to pass in review; and if one may judge by their Looks, most of them seem’d at least to deserve the Wheel. This day we gave a name to one of the finest Plants in the whole Levant; and because M. Gundelscheirner discover’d it first, we agreed that in Justice it ought to bear his Name. By ill fortune we had nothing but Water to celebrate the feast ; but this agreed the better with this Ceremony, for the Plant grows no where but in dry stony places. The Bassa’s Musick struck up just at the instant, which wc took for a good Omen: yet we were a long while before we could find a Latin Name equivalent to that gallant Man’s. We concluded that the Plant should be call’d Gundelia\
Tournefort’s copperplate engraving (de Toumefort, 1718: plate 103 - see fig. 1), is named as Gundelia Orientalis, Acanthi aculeati folioy Capite glabro Coroll. Inst. Rei herb. 15, a polynomial cited by Linnaeus (1753: 814). Linnaeus celebrated both of the botanists on the expedition when he created the binomial for the plant about which Toumefort had written so glowingly.
Morphological intrigue
That Gundelia toumefortii resembles a generic thistle is in little doubt; Rauwolf referred to it, as did de Toumefort (1718: 183), and all authors since. However, Tournefort’s eye for detail determined aspects of the ‘Tops like those of the Fuller’s Thistle’ were strange. He noted that the ‘Flowers are truly Fleurons’ and the ‘Embryos are divided into as many Boxes or Apartments as there arc Fleurons. Most of these Embroy’s [sic!] prove abortive except the middlemost, which pressing the others makes them perish’. The terminology' may be somewhat strange, but Toumefort had noticed something that has confused botanists until the late 1980s! Tournefort’s ‘Tops’ are what we now call third-order syncephalia (a synflorescence in my terminology!), also found in Platycarpha Less. (Tribe Platycarpheae), Triplocephalum O. HofFm. (Tribe Inuleae) and Lagascea Cav. (Tribe Heliantheae). His ‘Fleurons’ are now called florets; ‘Embryos’ are what we would probably term disseminules, however the structure is more complicated as will be seen below.
In his Encyclopédie méthodique Lamarck (1789) likened the thistle-like leaves to those of the ‘Chardon’ (= Cynara cardunculus L.) or ‘Carline’ (= Carlina vulgaris L.), the habit and latex to that of ‘Scolyme’ (= Scolymus L., probably S. maculatus L.) and form of the synflorescence was likened to those found in ‘Cardère’ (= Dipsacus L.) or ‘Panicaut’ and ‘Panicaut des Alpes’ (= Eyngium L. and Eyngium alpinum L.).
Cassini (1821), in his continuing treatment of the Composées for Cuvier’s Dictionnaire, recognized the complexity of the flower heads linking it with analogous genera such as Coiymbium L. [1 floret per capitulum; Tribe Corymbieae], Lagascea Cav. [1 floret per capitulum, rarely 2-3; Tribe Heliantheae], Rolandra Rottb. [1 floret per capitulum; Tribe Vemonieae] and Elephantopus L. [2-4 florets per capitulum; Tribe Vemonieae], but regretted somewhat that he’d only been able to look at the genus based on very old material. However, Cassini also credited Gaertner (1791), and a quick examination of Gaertner’s description showed that he was aware of ‘Flosc. marginales in singulo lobulo masculisteriles; centralis, unus aut geminus, androgynus, fertilis. Semina lobulis immersa, coronata pappo substipitato, ... ’ Gaertner’s tab. 163 was an excellent, very accurate representation of the synflorescences (see Fig. 2).
Unfortunately, the whole flowrering structure has been continuously misinterpreted (e.g. Kupicha, 1975; Burtt, 1977; Bremer, 1994; Vassilczenko, [1961] 2000 [in English]). Most authors interpreted the disseminule, from which the whole spherical, or Teasel-like, synflorescence appeared to be constructed, was the primary capitulum when in reality it is nothing of the sort. The disseminule is in fact a secondary capitulum derived from a group of single-flowered primary capitula, the outer four or six subsidiar)' capitula with functionally male florets (acting initially as ‘pollen donors’, and then as ‘protective structures’ - Claflen-Bockhoff, 1996: 150) surrounding a central capitulum (with a perfect fertile floret). The secondary heads are released as the functional dispersal units, or disseminules, admirably illustrated by Vitek et al. (2010). Gundelia ‘is probably without parallel in the whole family’ because of this structure (Claflen-Bockhoff, 1996: 150).
Taxonomy and Nomenclature
Intrafamilial classification. The earliest accepted infrafamil-ial placement of Gundelia appears to be that of Cassini (1821) when it was placed in the tribe Vemonieae, along with similar genera (see above). However, he later specifically placed it in to the ‘Ver-noniées-Rolandrées (Vernonieae-Rolandreae)’ (Cassini, 1828: 345), later formalized as the subtribe Rolandrinae by Lessing (1831: 105). Although Cassini had recognized the complex synflorescence, and described it under Gundelia, he later had a complete change of mind and simply overturned Linnaeus (Cassini, 1828: 344), creating Gundekheimera in its stead! This generic name is illegitimate.
Within half a century, the tribal position of Gundelia was cast into doubt when Bentham & Hooker (1873: 211) placed
A useful summary of the ins and outs of the genus was provided by Karis et al. (2009) in a summary table of ‘Different classifications of Arctotidae’, noting that Bremer (1994), based on cladistic analyses, placed it in the Arctotideae subtribe Gorteriinae Benth. & Hook.fi, although it was excluded by Karis [2006] (2007); Jeffrey [2006] (2007): 199) has since modified its position, placing it in the tribe Gundclicae DC. ex Lecoq &Juilllet.
The most recent proposed position, which is one I do not accept, is alongside Scolymus L. (Karis et al., 2001 ), Catananche L. and Hymenonema Cass., in the ‘Cichorieac subtribe Scolyminae Less.' (Kilian et al., 2009). Gundelia would stand out in this tribe in that it possesses an actinomorphic lobed corolla, unlike the remainder of the tribe Lactuceae (= Cichorieac), and although it possesses latex, several other genera, in a diversity of tribes also do. I am happy to accept Jeffrey’s views on the position of Gundelia, in its own tribe.
HOW MANY SPECIES ARE THERE? A PROBLEM OF COROLLA COLOUR?
The earliest descriptions of‘gundelia’ referred to the corollas as cream or flesh coloured (Rauwolf, 1583) and purplish (de Tournefort, 1718), and Linnaeus (1753) clearly recognized both but merely placed the purple corolla’d plants under his [unnamed] variety the genus being monospecific. However, there is a common problem with herbarium material in that the corollas close up so the inner face of the corolla lobes is not visible, and is often not apparent when opened - plus there are often no colour notes on the collecting labels of any merit. Distinguishing the colour/ s of the corollas is often difficult in dry material. Bommüller (1939) formally recognized plants with the purplish corollas as forma purpurascens; earlier descriptions of infraspecific taxa solely relied up leaf characters regardless of corolla colour.
Kupicha (1975) and Rechinger (1989), in their flora accounts, and Bremer (1994) and Jeffrey [2006] (2007) in their generic treatments, treated Gundelia as monospecific and the apparently wide variation in corolla colour unrelated to gross morphology. Al-Taey & Hossain ( 1984) studied material in some detail and recognized that Bornmiiller’s and Tournefort’s variants were in fact a second species, G. rosea Hossain & Al-Taey. Vitek et al. (2010) studied much material, especially live, in nature, and came to the conclusion that there are perfecdy recognisable units that can be treated as separate species; the genus now has at least three, possibly four species! The typification of the genus by Vitek & Jarvis (2007) anchored the cream/yellowish corolla’d plants as typical Gundelia toumefortii, a corolla colour that can be found throughout the species distribution - alongside that of the darker corollas.
Whilst there is little doubt that there is a significant variation in corolla colour I have one observation, and that stems directly from the writing of this article. I§ik Güner’s colour plate is from material collected in Turkey (from near Ankara), a considerable distance from the nearest similar coloured corolla’d taxon provided with a name by Vitek et al. (2010) - Gundelia aragatsi Vitek et al.; I$ik Güner’s plant is most certainly G. toumefortii. Clearly, much more detailed studies are still needed into this complex.
The Shroud of Turin
One of the most startling recent findings is that pollen of Gundelia toumefortii was found on the Shroud of Turin during investigations in 1998. Danin (1998) and Danin & Baruch (1998) reported the palynological analysis of pollen by Dr Uri Baruch, of ‘sticky tape’ samples taken from the Shroud by Dr Max Frei in 1973 and 1978. A total of 313 pollen grains had been examined, 91 pollen grains (29%) were of Gundelia, suggesting that with so much pollen (> 10 grains in an area of 5 cm) flowering plants were probably placed on the Shroud. Natural pollen rain in Israel rarely produced more than one or two grains of Gundelia. Gundelia flowers from February in Israel (in the warm semi-desert areas) through to May (in Jerusalem) suggesting a timeframe during which they may have been placed on the Shroud. Denin even pinpointed the Shroud’s locality' as coming from an area 10-20 km east and west ofjerusalem as demonstrated by the pollen, and access to live plants shown in the images of plants captured from the Shroud (which included one of a synflorescence of Gundelia seen close to the right shoulder); the date probably in the spring between March and April. The presence of fygophyllum dumosum Boiss. leaves made this hypothesis probable because of the limited distribution, seasonality of leaf growth, and overlapping distribution with Gundelia.
Possible religious connections are not reserved to just the Shroud. Indeed some scholars think that the tumbleweed referred to in Psalms 83:14 is none other than Gundelia toumefortii (Zohary, 1982; Duke et ai, 2008; Musselman, 2012). The possibility of Gundelia being a contender for the ‘Crown of thorns’ is somewhat more tenuous.
Cultivation. As far as can be determined, Lamarck (1789: 60) cited both ‘André Michaut’ [sic!] [= André Michaux (1746-1803), French botanist and explorer of Iran (1782-1785), North America (1785-1796) and later to Madagascar (1800-1805), where he died] and ‘de la Billardiere’ [sic!] [= Jacques Julien Houttou de Labil-lardicrc (1775-1834), French explorer and botanist of the Near East (1786)] as both having sent seeds to the Jardin du Roi from their travels in the Levant. Since the late 18th century, Gundelia toumefortii has been grown intermittently at the Ecole de Botanique, in the Jardin du Roi, Paris, and was recorded in the mid-19th century- (Verlot, 1864). Seed proved slow to germinate, young plants were planted out outside but required a light, well-drained soil, and frost protection (using a cloche) during the winter. Introductions by the French botanical explorer Balansa (1825-1891) in the late 1850s, from ‘Asia Minor’, took some 3 years to establish and begin flowering, putting on little growth during the first year - having taken 2 years to germinate.
Plants are best grown in the rock garden, or on raised beds, and given good drainage in a stony or gritty soil in full sun and the species improbably hardy to about — 15°C/5°F (see Jeffrey, 1992).
Availability. Gundelia is not currently listed on the Royal Horticultural Society Plant Finder web pages, and has only been listed from two sources since 1999 (Lord, 1999; 2004) in the printed version. It does not appear in the RHS Encyclopaedia (RHS, 1996), but was mentioned by Jeffrey (1992).
Propagation. Natural propagation of Gundelia is hinted at in one of the vernacular names, Tumbleweed. A note by Harris on a herbarium specimen in Kew {R. W. Harm VV1451) indicates how the old inflorescences become tumbleweeds, and how the achenes are distributed.
‘The whole inflorescence loosens first below ground level, at a discoloured section, included in the specimens, and blows away. Several inflorescences were found at a distance from the plants; others, still on the plants, broke olf at a touch’.
Gillet provided a startling account (see Uses) of seeing them distributed by whirlwinds and carried hundreds of feet into the air! In this way long-distance dispersal of the disseminules is guaranteed!
In cultivation a little more purpose is required, but regrettably information is somewhat lacking. When available, Gundelia is best propagated from seed sown in the spring in a cold frame. When large enough seedlings should be pricked out into individual pots. Verlot’s comments, dating from the mid-19th century (Verlot, 1864), suggest growth is very slow’ at first - after a very protracted germination! The results of Shibli et al. (2009), albeit under laboratory conditions, suggest that the highest germination percentages (nearly 90%) are obtained by soaking the disseminules in a solution of 250 ppm GA3 for 6 hours, and placing them in an seed tray containing a 1:1 mix of peat: Perlite, under intermittent mist at 24±2°C. The germination percentages were obtained after 4 weeks.
Jeffrey (1992), in referring propagation to that under Carduncellus spp., also suggests division, but I have not been able to find any references - anywhere - to the success rate or methodology.
