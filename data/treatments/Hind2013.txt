763. GUNDELIA TOURNEFORTII 
Compositae 
Nicholas Hind 
Summary. Gundelia tournefortii L. (Compositae: Gundelieae) is described and illustrated, and its strange inflorescence morphology highlighted. The history of the discovery of this fascinating plant is covered from one of the first natural history collections made in the late 16th century in the Levant. The problematic taxonomy of this genus is discussed, both supragenerically and infragenerically. The species has very rarely been cultivated throughout its recent history, making a commentary on its cultivation and propagation a little difficult. The wide range of uses cover a history dating back at least 10,000 years, from the Neolithic sites of Iraq and Turkey, to its present day usage in the region. The importance of herbarium specimen data, as well as literature, for the ethnobotany of taxa is emphasized. A possible biblical connection is commented on in relation to the Shroud of Turin. 
The subject of this plate is one of the more unusual plants to have appeared in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in that it has a demonstrable history of use of over 10,000 years, is still very rarely cultivated, and has potential links to the dawn of Christianity, via the Shroud of Turin; it also has one of the most complicated inflorescence structures in the family, and an interesting taxonomy. The plant is Gundelia tourneforti L. (Compositae: Gundelieae). 
16TH CENTURY HISTORY Gundelia tournefortü, as we now know it, was first recorded in one of the earliest natural history collections made in the Near East by the German physician, botanist and traveller, Leonhard Rauwolf also as Leonhart Rauwolff] (1535–1596). His voyage, between 1573 and 1575, was principally made to search for supplies of herbal medicines, the botanical collections (which he glued upon paper very carefully ... with great and peculiar care' ... 'so that they are to be seen in their natural colours so exact, as if they were green.' - translations from Ray, 1738) preserved in bound quarto-sized, and one folio, herbaria (now in Leiden). A description of these volumes is provided by Legré (1900), covering the French collections, based in part upon Saint-Lager's account (Saint-Lager, 1885: 69–85), who also detailed the 338 specimens in the folio volume (the 'Vierte Kreutterbuch...),

most collected during Rauwolf's Levant voyage - page number 251 is the specimen of Gundelia, from 'Alep. Baibout en Anatolie'. Rauwolf's views on the countries and cities, peoples and religion, and plants were recorded in the German Aigentliche beschreibung der Raiß, so er vor diser zeit gegen Auffgang inn die Morgenländer (Rauwolf, 1583) – 'A true account of the voyage to the Levant ... The Morgenländ (literally the *land of the morning") of the title is the Levant in English (from the French levant = ‘rising' i.e. where the sun rises), and Bilād ash-Shām 
in Arabic (دال بدم اشلام 
The Levant is an archaic English word, according to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, dating from the late 15th century, and is defined as the 'eastern part of the Mediterranean with its islands and neighbouring countries'. It is usually considered to include modern Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Cyprus, Hatay Province and parts of southern Turkey, northwestern Iraq and the Sinai Peninsula. The Levant portion of Rauwolf's expedition began in Tripoli, Lebanon, to the 'mighty city' (translated as the 'potent city' in Ray, 1738) of Aleppo, Baghdad and Mosul, returning to Tripoli and ending with a trip to Jerusalem. Rauwolf left Tripoli on November 9, 1573 bound for Aleppo (probably arriving later that month), spending several months in and around the city. Chapter VI of his book was 'Of the situation of the potent city of Aleppo; of the buildings therof, and also of the delicate fruits and fine plants, that grow there, within and without gardens'. [Translation from Staphorst in Ray, 1738]. 
17TH CENTURY HISTORY Rauwolf's Aigentliche beschreibung der Rail was well illustrated with woodcut illustrations, including Gundelia, whose plate was effectively repeated in Bauhin et al.'s Historia plantarum universalis (1650–1651) under the name Hacub sive Silybum quibusdam. The plant was found in the area around Aleppo, in Syria. Bauhin et al.'s short description appears to have been taken straight from Rauwolf's account and suggested the plant was known to Dioscorides as Silybum, and to Serapio (Joannis Filii Serapionis or Yúhānnā Ibn Serapion; author of a 9th Century work called 'Practica ... an ancient materia medica as Hacub Alcardeg; the Arabic KA'UB or A'KUB is still in use today. It should, however, be noted that Rauwolf (1583), Bauhin et al. 


117 
(1650-1651) and Ray (1738) were incorrect in declaring that this plant was Dioscorides' Silybum - that plant is now considered to be Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (the MILK THISTLE). 
Based on Rauwolf's description Morison (1699: 167 - albeit in a work published long after he was dead), although admitting he had not seen the plant, provided a new name - Eryngium Syriacum foliis Chamaeleontis longis spinosis – based on the apparent similarity of the synflorescence to the inflorescences in several species of Eryngium L. [Umbelliferae). 
18TH CENTURY HISTORY A little while after the publication of his seminal work, Eléments de botanique, ou méthode pour reconnaitre les plantes (1694), Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656-1708) travelled together with the German physician and botanist Andreas von Gundelsheimer (1668-1715) (eventually a physician to the Prussian royalty) and the painter Claude Aubriet (1665-1742), who became the principle artist at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris (where Tournefort had earlier been appointed professor of botany in 1683). Their expedition, between 1700 and 1702, was to travel through Greece, Turkey, Armenia (which included parts of present day Turkey) and Persia. Tournefort's account of the expedition was published posthumously as Relation d'un voyage du Levant (de Tournefort, 1717), the second volume of which appeared in English (de Tournefort, 1718). Tournefort's prose in his 
Voyage into the Levant is worth repeating here: 
Lett. VI. p. 187: 'We were oblig'd then to leave Baibout the 11th of June. We were told the Bassa' had pardoned all the Prisoners. Many in our Caravan commended his Clemency; others blamed him for not making some Examples. The Rogues were made to pass in review; and if one may judge by their Looks, most of them seem'd at least to deserve the Wheel. This day we gave a name to one of the finest Plants in the whole Levant; and because M. Gundelscheimer discover'd it first, we agreed that in Justice it ought to bear his Name. By ill fortune we had nothing but Water to celebrate the feast, but this agreed the better with this Ceremony, for the Plant grows no where but in dry stony places. The Bassa's Musick struck up just at the instant, which

we took for a good Omen: yet we were a long while before we could find a Latin Name equivalent to that gallant Man's. We concluded that the Plant should be call'd Gundelia'. 
Tournefort's copperplate engraving (de Tournefort, 1718: plate 103 - see fig. 1), is named as Gundelia Orientalis, Acanthi aculeati folio, Capite glabro Coroll. Inst. Rei herb. 15, a polynomial cited by Linnaeus (1753: 814). Linnaeus celebrated both of the botanists on the expedition when he created the binomial for the plant about which Tournefort had written so glowingly. 
MORPHOLOGICAL INTRIGUE 
That Gundelia toumefortii resembles a generic thistle is in little doubt; Rauwolf referred to it, as did de Tournefort (1718: 183), and all authors since. However, Tournefort's eye for detail determined aspects of the “Tops like those of the Fuller's Thistle' were strange. He noted that the 'Flowers are truly Fleurons' and the 'Embryos are divided into as many Boxes or Apartments as there are Fleurons. Most of these Embroy's (sic!) prove abortive except the middlemost, which pressing the others makes them perish'. The terminology may be somewhat strange, but Tournefort had noticed something that has confused botanists until the late 1980s! Tournefort's "Tops' are what we now call third-order syncephalia (a synflorescence in my terminology!), also found in Platycarpha Less. (Tribe Platycarpheae), Triplocephalum O. Hoffm. (Tribe Inuleae) and Lagascea Cav. (Tribe Heliantheae). His 'Fleurons are now called florets; 'Embryos' are what we would probably term disseminules, however the structure is more complicated as will be seen below. 
In his Encyclopédie méthodique Lamarck (1789) likened the thistle-like leaves to those of the 'Chardon' = Cynara cardunculus L.) or 'Carline (= Carlina vulgaris L.), the habit and latex to that of 'Scolyme' = Scolymus L., probably S. maculatus L.) and form of the synflorescence was likened to those found in 'Cardère' = Dipsacus L.) or "Panicaut' and 'Panicaut des Alpes' (= Eryngium L. and Eryngium alpinum L.). 
Cassini (1821), in his continuing treatment of the Composées for Cuvier's Dictionnaire, recognized the complexity of the flower heads linking it with analogous genera such as Corymbium L. [1 floret per capitulum; Tribe Corymbieae), Lagascea Cav. [1 floret per capitulum, rarely 2-3; Tribe Heliantheae), Rolandra Røttb. [1 


119 
foret per capitulum; Tribe Vernonieae) and Elephantopus L. [2-4 florets per capitulum; Tribe Vernonieae), but regretted somewhat that he'd only been able to look at the genus based on very old material. However, Cassini also credited Gaertner (1791), and a quick examination of Gaertner's description showed that he was aware of 'Flosc. marginales in singulo lobulo masculi, steriles; centralis, unus aut geminus, androgynus, fertilis. Semina lobulis immersa, coronata pappo substipitato, ...' Gaertner's tab. 163 was an excellent, very accurate representation of the synflorescences (see Fig. 2). 
Unfortunately, the whole flowering structure has been contin uously misinterpreted (e.g. Kupicha, 1975; Burtt, 1977; Bremer, 1994; Vassilczenko, [1961] 2000 [in English]). Most authors interpreted the disseminule, from which the whole spherical, or Teasel-like, synflorescence appeared to be constructed, was the primary capitulum when in reality it is nothing of the sort. The disseminule is in fact a secondary capitulum derived from a group of single-flowered primary capitula, the outer four or six subsidiary capitula with functionally male florets (acting initially as "pollen donors, and then as 'protective structures' - Claßen-Bockhoff, 1996: 150) surrounding a central capitulum with a perfect fertile 
et). The secondary heads are released as the functional dispersal units, or disseminules, admirably illustrated by Vitek et al. (2010). Gundelia 'is probably without parallel in the whole family because of this structure (Claßen-Bockhoff, 1996: 150). 
TAXONOMY AND NOMENCLATURE 
INFRAFAMILIAL CLASSIFICATION. The earliest accepted infrafamil ial placement of Gundelia appears to be that of Cassini (1821) when it was placed in the tribe Vernonieae, along with similar genera (see above). However, he later specifically placed it in to the 'Ver noniées-Rolandrées (Vernonieae-Rolandreae)' (Cassini, 1828: 345), later formalized as the subtribe Rolandrinae by Lessing (1831: 105). Although Cassini had recognized the complex synflorescence, and described it under Gundelia, he later had a complete change of mind and simply overturned Linnaeus (Cassini, 1828: 344), creating Gundelsheimera in its stead! This generic name is illegitimate. 
Within half a century, the tribal position of Gundelia was cast into doubt when Bentham & Hooker (1873: 211) placed 


121 
A useful summary of the ins and outs of the genus was provided by Karis et al. (2009) in a summary table of 'Different classifications of Arctotidae', noting that Bremer (1994), based on cladistic analyses, placed it in the Arctotideae subtribe Gorteriinae Benth. & Hook.f., although it was excluded by Karis [2006] (2007); Jeffrey [2006] (2007): 199) has since modified its position, placing it in the tribe Gundelieae DC. ex Lecoq & Juilllet. 
The most recent proposed position, which is one I do not accept, is alongside Scolymus L. (Karis et al., 2001), Catananche L. and Hymenonema Cass., in the 'Cichorieae subtribe Scolyminae Less.' (Kilian et al., 2009). Gundelia would stand out in this tribe in that it possesses an actinomorphic lobed corolla, unlike the remainder of the tribe Lactuceae (= Cichoricae), and although it possesses latex, several other genera, in a diversity of tribes also do. I am happy to accept Jeffrey's views on the position of Gundelia, in its own tribe. 
HOW MANY SPECIES ARE THERE? A PROBLEM OF COROLLA COLOUR? The earliest descriptions of 'gundelia' referred to the corollas as cream or flesh coloured (Rauwolf, 1583) and purplish (de Tournefort, 1718), and Linnaeus (1753) clearly recognized both but merely placed the purple corolla'd plants under his (unnamed) variety B, the genus being monospecific. However, there is a common problem with herbarium material in that the corollas close up so the inner face of the corolla lobes is not visible, and is often not apparent when opened – plus there are often no colour notes on the collecting labels of any merit. Distinguishing the colour/s of the corollas is often difficult in dry material. Bornmüller (1939) formally recognized plants with the purplish corollas as forma purpurascens; earlier descriptions of infraspecific taxa solely relied up leaf characters regardless of corolla colour. 
Kupicha (1975) and Rechinger (1989), in their flora accounts, and Bremer (1994) and Jeffrey [2006] (2007) in their generic treat ments, treated Gundelia as monospecific and the apparently wide variation in corolla colour unrelated to gross morphology. Al-Taey & Hossain (1984) studied material in some detail and recognized that Bornmüller's and Tournefort's variants were in fact a second species, G.rosea Hossain & Al-Taey. Vitek et al. (2010) studied much material, 
124 


especially live, in nature, and came to the conclusion that there are perfectly recognisable units that can be treated as separate species; the genus now has at least three, possibly four species! The typification of the genus by Vitek & Jarvis (2007) anchored the cream/yellowish corolla'd plants as typical Gundelia tournefortii, a corolla colour that can be found throughout the species distribution - alongside that of the darker corollas. 
Whilst there is little doubt that there is a significant variation in corolla colour I have one observation, and that stems directly from the writing of this article. Işık Güner's colour plate is from material collected in Turkey (from near Ankara), a considerable distance from the nearest similar coloured corolla'd taxon provided with a name by Vitek et al. (2010) - Gundelia aragatsi Vitek et al., Işık Güner's plant is most certainly G. tourneforti. Clearly, much more detailed studies are still needed into this complex. 
THE SHROUD OF TURIN One of the most startling recent findings is that pollen of Gundelia tournefortii was found on the Shroud of Turin during investigations in 1998. Danin (1998) and Danin & Baruch (1998) reported the palynological analysis of pollen by Dr Uri Baruch, of 'sticky tape' samples taken from the Shroud by Dr Max Frei in 1973 and 1978. A total of 313 pollen grains had been examined, 91 pollen grains (29%) were of Gundelia, suggesting that with so much pollen (> 10 grains in an area of 5 cm?) flowering plants were probably placed on the Shroud. Natural pollen rain in Israel rarely produced more than one or two grains of Gundelia. Gundelia flowers from February in Israel (in the warm semi-desert areas) through to May (in Jerusalem) suggesting a timeframe during which they may have been placed on the Shroud. Denin even pinpointed the Shroud's locality as coming from an area 10-20 km east and west of Jerusalem as demonstrated by the pollen, and access to live plants shown in the images of plants captured from the Shroud (which included one of a synflorescence of Gundelia seen close to the right shoulder); the date probably in the spring between March and April. The presence of Zygophyllum dumosum Boiss. leaves made this hypothesis probable because of the limited distribution, seasonality of leaf growth, and overlapping distribution with Gundelia. 


125 
Possible religious connections are not reserved to just the Shroud. Indeed some scholars think that the tumbleweed referred to in Psalms 83:14 is none other than Gundelia tournefortii (Zohary, 1982; Duke et al., 2008; Musselman, 2012). The possibility of Gundelia being a contender for the Crown of thorns' is somewhat more tenuous. 
CULTIVATION. As far as can be determined, Lamarck (1789: 60) cited both 'André Michaut' (sic!] [= André Michaux (1746-1803), French botanist and explorer of Iran (1782-1785), North America (1785-1796) and later to Madagascar (1800-1805), where he died] and de la Billardiere (sic!] [= Jacques Julien Houttou de Labil lardière (1775-1834), French explorer and botanist of the Near East (1786)] as both having sent seeds to the Jardin du Roi from their trav els in the Levant. Since the late 18th century, Gundelia tournefortii has been grown intermittently at the École de Botanique, in the Jardin du Roi, Paris, and was recorded in the mid-19th century (Verlot, 1864). Seed proved slow to germinate, young plants were planted out out side but required a light, well-drained soil, and frost protection (using a cloche) during the winter. Introductions by the French botanical explorer Balansa (1825-1891) in the late 1850s, from 'Asia Minor, took some 3 years to establish and begin flowering, putting on little growth during the first year – having taken 2 years to germinate. 
Plants are best grown in the rock garden, or on raised beds, and given good drainage in a stony or gritty soil in full sun and the species is probably hardy to about -15°C/5°F (see Jeffrey, 1992). 
AVAILABILITY, Gundelia is not currently listed on the Royal Horticul tural Society Plant Finder web pages, and has only been listed from two sources since 1999 (Lord, 1999; 2004) in the printed version. It does not appear in the RHS Encyclopaedia (RHS, 1996), but was mentioned by Jeffrey (1992). 
PROPAGATION. Natural propagation of Gundelia is hinted at in one of the vernacular names, TUMBLEWEED. A note by Harris on a herbarium specimen in Kew (R. W. Harris W1451) indicates how the old inflorescences become tumbleweeds, and how the achenes are distributed 
The whole inflorescence loosens first below ground level, at a discoloured section, included in the specimens, and blows away. Several inflorescences were found at a distance from the plants; others, still on the plants, broke off at a touch'.

Gillet provided a startling account (see USES) of seeing them distributed by whirlwinds and carried hundreds of feet into the air! In this way long-distance dispersal of the disseminules is guaranteed! 
In cultivation a little more purpose is required, but regrettably information is somewhat lacking. When available, Gundelia is best propagated from seed sown in the spring in a cold frame. When large enough seedlings should be pricked out into individual pots. Verlot's comments, dating from the mid-19th century (Verlot, 1864), suggest growth is very slow at first – after a very protracted germination! The results of Shibli et al. (2009), albeit under laboratory conditions, suggest that the highest germination percentages (nearly 90%) are obtained by soaking the disseminules in a solution of 250 ppm GA3 for 6 hours, and placing them in an seed tray containing a 1:1 mix of peat: Perlite, under intermittent mist at 24 +2°C. The germination percentages were obtained after 4 weeks. 
Jeffrey (1992), in referring propagation to that under Carduncellus spp., also suggests division, but I have not been able to find any references – anywhere - to the success rate or methodology.

CONSERVATION STATUS. If considered in the broadest concept Gundelia toumeforti is Not Threatened. Locally, however, the plant has been recorded as Endangered - Cyprus (Tsintides et al., 2007), where it was recorded as EN: Blabi-v) + 2ab(i-v), because of few known localities, relatively few individuals, land clearance, herbicide use, and especially over-collection of edible parts. It was declared as possibly extinct in at least three locations where it had been recorded in the past. In Israel only collection for private consumption is now permitted. Clearly, continued pressures (predominantly exploitation for food) on natural populations may well threaten the species in some arcas and a reassessment is certainly needed in many countries. 
USES – FOOD, DRINK AND FODDER, ETC. 
The varied uses to which A'KUB (Gundelia tournefortii, and most probably the other species) have been put has been documented in summary by Lev-Yadum & Abbo (1999). However, notes of first hand observation are always useful to supplement literature records and its worthwhile covering the varied uses of these remarkable plants here. A direct comparison, spanning nearly three centuries, is worth making. 
Ray (1738: 49) provided a translation of Rauwolf's account (from his visit to the ancient city of Aleppo, in northern Syria), saying 
'The other sort is also very plentiful, and is found in dry and rough places, which the inhabitants to this day, with Serapio, call Hacub, whereof he maketh mention in his 295th chapter, under the name of Hacub Alcardeg, whereof they cut in the spring the young shoots or sprouts, that grow round about it, boil and eat it as we do Asparagus, corruptly call'd Sparrowgrass; the whole plant is very like our Carlina, only this hath bigger, higher and more prickly heads, whereon appear flesh-coulour'd flowers. It being that it is every way like it, and that also the root hath the same virtue, for if you steep it in water, and drink of it, it maketh you vomit and fling up: therefore I am of opinion, that without doubt it must be the true

by the collector. Collections of Gundelia in the Herbarium at Kew are no different. The labels of Rawi & Gillett 7571 (sheet 1), and Rawi & Gillett 10577, have been profusely annotated by Jan Gillett (1911-1995) in his inimitable style covering many of the uses, and peculiarities of Gundelia tournefortii. Gillet's note on the former reads:

“This plant is characteristic of moist type steppe and Quercus degilops where coppiced. The young shoots are eaten as a delicacy like asparagus and are brought to Baghdad market from the north. The fruits are also eaten as nuts, the spines being first singed off. They are also brought to Baghdad market. The mature foliage is gathered together as fodder in spite of the spines'. Of the latter, which duplicates part of Rawi & Gillett 7571 some additional details are provided: '... The hard inflorescences each contain a single fruit, like a nut and these form an article of commerce reaching the bazaars in Baghdad. The old dry foliage, in spite of the spines is collected as winter fodder. The fruiting inflorescences are distributed by wind devils (whirlwinds). I have seen them carried hundreds of feet into the air'. 
FLIELU 
Jan Gillet's notes summarize, from his first hand experiences, many of the uses of Gundelia, but it is worth covering some in a little more details. 
The young shoots are clearly a delicate vegetable throughout much of gundelia's range. The clipping season for G. tourneforti is during the spring (January to February in Israel and Palestine) but previous commercial exploitation (mentioned by Gillet for Iraq) has now led to legal restrictions in Israel so that only collection for personal use is allowed. - See CONSERVATION STATUS above 
Clearly, rural communities are still using Gundelia as a vegetable in other parts of its range. Ruckšāns (2007: 318 & plate 265) shows a 'Kurdish farmer' demonstrating how to find food in the mountains - an interesting diversion in a book on bulbous plants, and Gundelia isn't even in the index! The farmer demonstrated how to strip the leaves off and opened up the core of the stem' providing a source of refreshment - but not to eat every day. 
The young synflorescences have a rich flavour apparently some what similar to artichoke hearts (Cynara cardunculus). It is considered a high quality wild vegetable upgrading salads and warm vegetarian side dishes and Davis 3456 indicates that the synflorescences are eaten

like globe artichokes in Cyprus. The simplest of recipes comes from several sources and indicates trimmed inflorescence initials are cov ered with mincemeat, fried in olive oil and then simmered in a lemon juice based sauce (see Lev-Yadum & Abbo, 1999; Wright, 2001). 
Kupicha (1975: 326) noted that a chewing gum (KENGER SAKIZI) is made from the latex, and a coffee substitute (KENGER KAHVESI) is made from the achenes (probably the disseminules) after torrefaction. The reference to chewing gum is inferred from the comments by de Tournefort (1718) referring to the fact that 'All the Plants yields a very sweet Milk, which clots into Grains of Mastick like that of the Carline of Columna'. Adil Güner (pers. comm.) has also indicated that the roots are similarly treated to provide a coffee substitute as well. 
The oldest demonstrable use was indicated by Prance & Nesbitt (2005) noting that 'In the recent past mature fruits have also been used as a source of oil. Charred fruits at Neolithic sites in Iraq and Turkey are evidence that oil extraction dates back at least 10,000 years. The potential of Gundelia has been well-demonstrated by Khanzadeh et al. (2012) where the seed oil content of the achenes has been shown to be 22.8%, with the oleic acid and linoleic acid of this oil to be 28 and 54.6% respectively, which puts the oil from Gundelia on a par with other vegetable oils such as soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. This suggests that it would be a potential source of edible oil; the aim is obviously to get a spineless plant! 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. The author would like to thank Işık Güner for preparing the colour plate from wild sourced material in Turkey (from near Ankara, at Polatlı), her father Prof. Dr Adil Güner, currently Director of the Nezahat Gökyiğ[g]it Botanik Bahcesi, İstanbul, Turkey, for providing a copy of issue of The Karaca Arboretum Magazine, and to Christine Grey-Wilson in preparing the relevant line drawings from herbarium material many years ago for the Flora of Iraq treatment of the genus. The author would also like to thank Christopher Ryan, Living Collections Department, RBG, Kew, for his colour photographs of more typical G. tournefortzi taken in Iran, and to Martyn Rix for his photograph of Gundelia habitat in Turkey.
