# Agent and Citation are 2 complex objects used for several fields further down.
# We provide here a complete definition that is referenced below.


# +++ AGENT +++
# Agent entities are used for many fields below and can be either a person, an organisation or a combination of both.
# The minimum requirement is either a persons family name, an organisation name or any of the identifiers for them.
#
# An agent combines the following fields for a person with fields for an organisation:
#
# PERSON fields
#   orcid: ORCID person ID, https://orcid.org  example: 0000-0001-9745-636X
#   family: last name
#   given: first name
# ORGANISATION fields
#   rorid: ROR organisation ID, https://ror.org  example: https://ror.org/05fjyn938
#   organisation: name of the organisation / institution
#   department: subunit within the organisation, sometimes a project
#   city: city
#   state: state or province
#   country: ISO 2 letter country code
# SHARED fields
#   email: email address
#   url: webpage
#   note: miscellaneous extra information, used for contributor roles
#
# In case no parsed agent can be provided it is permitted to supply a list of simple strings which will then be parsed.
# For the parsing to given and family name to correctly work it is highly recommended to use one of the following formats:
# GivenName FamilyName: Only use this in case the last name is a single token. There can be many first names e.g. John Paul Sartre
# FamilyName, GivenName: Supports any conmplex last name. E.g. Brinch Hansen, Per


# +++ REFERENCE CITATION +++
# We use BibTeX field keys to represent a structured citation:
#   id: identifier for the reference
#   type: the BibTeX Entry type, ie. article, book, inbook or misc which is the default if none is given
#   doi: DOI for the reference. Can be in addition to another identifier used as the ID above
#   author: The names of the author(s) as a list of Person objects with family & given (this deviates from BibTEX, see above for a Person)

#   year: The year of publication (or, if unpublished, the year of creation)
#   month: The month of publication (or, if unpublished, the month of creation) using integers from 1-12
#   series: The series of books the book was published in
#   volume: The volume of a journal or multi-volume book
#   number: The "(issue) number" of a journal or magazine if applicable. Note that this is not the "article number" assigned by some journals`.
#   edition: The edition of a book, long form (such as "First" or "Second")
#   chapter: The chapter number
#   pages: Page numbers, separated either by commas or double-hyphens.
#   publisher: The publisher's name
